# Lead-Rubber Isolator Material

## Description

<!-- 1 para about what an LR bearing is; a figure labelling the various parts; what physics this model captures: cavitation, buckling, shear coupling etc, Say that this element is based on Manishâ€™s report and cite the report and journal paper.-->

## Usage

<!-- Talk about the examples, show an isolator and the dimensions etc. You can even show the input and output files (look at the linear spring documentation to see examples for how to link them). Please talk about how to use this for axial, shear, and if there are any specific aspects to consider during seismic loading. -->

### Associated actions

<!-- To be written by CB. LRIsolator action and Common LRIsolator action -->

## Limitations

<!-- talk about how it is limited to very small rigid body rotations. any other limitations that you can think of. -->
